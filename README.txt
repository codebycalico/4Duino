4Duino (FourDuino)

An advanced Arduino library for controlling 4D Systems' GOLDELOX-based uOLED displays.

This library is in the public domain. Actually, I think I'll use the WTFPL. Same thing, right?


This library has been modified to work with PlatformIO in Visual Studios.
The repository is forked from the original 4Duino repository.
Made changes to the organization files, added files, changed .ino files to .cpp files, added .ini file, and a personal main.cpp file.

Using the uOLED-128-G1 (SGC) Serial OLED Display Module from 3D Systems.
